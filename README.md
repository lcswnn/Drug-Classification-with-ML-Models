# Drug-Classification-with-ML-Models
### Description
This project utilizes many different types of Classification Models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, MLP Classifier, and SVC Classifier. These were used to predict the type of drug per patient in the given data set. I first split the data into training and testing partitions, and fit them in each model. I then scored the models, printed those results out, and then graphed each performance against each other. We find that the Random Forset Classifier and the Decision Tree Classifier are both capable of having perfect performance most of the time, and a range of 0.96 - 1.0 each time you run it. 

**Libraries Used:** Pandas, Numpy, SKLearn (KNearestNeighbor, RandomForest, GaussianNB, DecisionTree, MLP, SVC, train_test_split), and MatPlotLib

Data used was found on Kaggle and formatted/one hot encoded in the jupyter notebook.
